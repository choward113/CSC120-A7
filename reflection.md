Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

For the House class, I overloaded the moveIn method because there are multiple aspects of moving into a house. The resident needs at least a name and the two overloaded methods give the option to include what floor and what room the resident is moving into.

For the Library class, I only overloaded the constructors because most of the other methods involve the Hashtable which could only take in a boolean and string value. 

For the Cafe class, I overloaded the sellCoffee() method to make a method to sell a default size coffee and a method that can make multiple of a custom coffee.  

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
